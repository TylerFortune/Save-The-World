    <div class="text-container">
        <p>This letter is intended for the normal humans of North Central
    College campus. The underground Web App Werewolves are
    writing to warn you. Due to our extreme living conditions
    underground, we have been able to hibernate into a longer life.
    Our founder, Werewolf Nwanze has warned us all that we must
    prepare for the fall out of the AI alien takeover scheduled to
    happen in just 15 weeks from now. These AI aliens are out to ruin
    the world by generating what Werewolf Nwanze describes as
    TERRIBLE code! Us werewolves need to bring this to your full
    attention as rumors are spread that the Computer Organization &
    Design students are using this TERRIBLE AI alien code to end us (the
    werewolves). The AI aliens have somehow convinced the
    Computer and Organization students with their alright writing
    abilities that we, the werewolves, are out to destroy North Central
    Campus, but that is false! We are set to come out of hibernation in
    15 weeks, not to destroy North Central College, but to prevent these
    low IQ Computer Organization & Design students from letting the
    AI Aliens take over the world.
    So us Web Werewolves have a plan. The plan is to use our
    best web application skills to prevent the AI aliens from taking
    over. We have a lot of key skills to learn until the takeover, so
    please follow along as I go into detail on how these skills can be
    used to prevent the AI alien takeover. The first skill that is critical to
    our survival is to learn how to manage our confidential
    conversations between us werewolves in order to be secure. This
    channel will be based on the HTTPs protocol to ensure all traffic is...
