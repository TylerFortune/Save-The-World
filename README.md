# Save The World Web Project

This project is a three-page website created for a course assignment. The site is based on the "Save the World" theme and demonstrates fundamental HTML and CSS skills. Each page is uniquely titled and contains meaningful content, navigation, and a variety of required HTML elements. The project is organized for clarity and ease of grading.

## Project Structure

- `index.html` — Main page
- `page2.html` — Second content page
- `page3.html` — Third content page
