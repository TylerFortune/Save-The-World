        <p>encrypted and the Aliens have no way of retrieving our
conversation. In addition, we will need to learn proper browser port
management to ensure that any data sent to our server is not just
encrypted through port 443 (HTTPs), but also stored directly to our
database on a self-hosted port that we check every bit of traffic to
better manage the scamming AI Aliens. That leads us to our final
skill to obtain a complete secure database to store all of our
research on these AI Aliens and additional data we will save for the
future attack (dates, responsibilities, etc.)
After learning these critical technical skills, we will hold the
power to have a complete self hosted web server. This allows our
data to be personalized to us and not shared to others, especially
the AI Aliens who will use it against us. This work will not be easy, as
the werewolf Fortune has experienced first hand. Therefore, we will
reach out to a separate group to join us within our study. This
group is referred to has the Operating Systems CSCE*420
professionals. Because they have expert level technical skills, the AI
Aliens will not stand a chance of taking over our world. Please see
the Operating System Professionalsâ€™ documentations for a full
detailed story on how they plan to eliminate these AI Aliens and
end it all for good!
